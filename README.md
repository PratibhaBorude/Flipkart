# Flipkart
I attempted to create the landing page of the popular shopping application, Flipkart, using a combination of CSS and HTML. During the process, I incorporated tables, borders, div elements, and various styles to enhance the visual appeal of the page. The HTML structure was carefully designed to achieve the desired layout and functionality of the landing page.
